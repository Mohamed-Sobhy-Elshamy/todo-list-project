## 🚀 How It Works

### **1. Adding Tasks**
You can add tasks by providing their description and priority. Each new task is added to the top of the list.

### **2. Viewing Tasks**### **2. عرض المهام**
The application displays all tasks in the list along with their priorities.

### **3. Marking Tasks as Done**
You can mark tasks as completed. Completed tasks will be appended with `(Done)`.

### **4. Viewing Completed Tasks**
Only tasks marked as `(Done)` are displayed under the completed tasks section.

### **5. Deleting Tasks**
Remove a task by its description. If the task doesn’t exist, nothing will happen.

### **6. Saving Tasks to a File**
The tasks are saved in a file named `tasks.txt` for future use. Each task’s description and priority are stored.

### **7. Loading Tasks from a File**
Tasks saved in `tasks.txt` are reloaded into the application, allowing you to pick up where you left off.
